title: "Idea Compass"
---

The Idea Compass is a method of notetaking created by [Fei-Ling Tseng](people/Fei-Ling%20Tseng.md) in her article [The essence of the Zettelkasten method, demystified](https://feeei.blog/essays/the-essence-of-the-zettelkasten-method-demystified/) and explained further in the talk [The Compass of Zettelkasten Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7r9t9T9Aww).

The core concept is how to expand and explore an idea by having a formalized "compass" framework for connecting and linking ideas.

You start with a particular idea and ask yourself specific questions corresponding to the four cardinal directions.

## North: Upstream

* Where does X come from?
* What is its origin?
* What belief does X support?
* What domain exists an order of magnitude higher? Zoom out.
* What gave birth to X?
* What causes X?

## South: Downstream

* Where can X lead to?
* What does X contribute to?
* What group/category could X be the headline of?
* What domain exists an order of magnitude lower? Zoom in.
* What does X nurture?

## West: Reinforcing

* What is similar to X?
* What other disciplines could X already exist in?
* What other disciplines could benefit from X?
* What are other ways to say/do X?

## East: Transformative

* What competes with X?
* What is the opposite of X?
* What is X missing?
* What is a disadvantage with X?
* What could supercharge X?
