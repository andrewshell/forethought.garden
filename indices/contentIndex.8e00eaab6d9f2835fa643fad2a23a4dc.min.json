You will have to determine that for yourself, and the **CRAAP Test** can help. The **CRAAP Test** is a list of questions to help you evaluate the information you find. Different criteria will be more or less important depending on your situation or need.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n### Currency : The timeliness of the information.\n- When was the information published or posted?\n- Has the information been revised or updated?\n- Does your topic require current information, or will older sources work as well?\n- Are the links functional?\n\n### Relevance : The importance of the information for your needs.\n- Does the information relate to your topic or answer your question?\n- Who is the intended audience?\n- Is the information at an appropriate level (i.e. not too elementary or advanced for your needs)?\n- Have you looked at a variety of sources before determining this is one you will use?\n- Would you be comfortable citing this source in your research paper?\n\n### Authority : The source of the information.\n- Who is the author/publisher/source/sponsor?\n- What are the author's credentials or organizational affiliations?\n- Is the author qualified to write on the topic?\n- Is there contact information, such as a publisher or email address?\n- Does the URL reveal anything about the author or source?\n\t- examples: **.com .edu .gov .org .net**\n\n### Accuracy : The reliability, truthfulness and correctness of the content.\n- Where does the information come from?\n- Is the information supported by evidence?\n- Has the information been reviewed or refereed?\n- Can you verify any of the information in another source or from personal knowledge?\n- Does the language or tone seem unbiased and free of emotion?\n- Are there spelling, grammar or typographical errors?\n\n### Purpose: The reason the information exists.\n- What is the purpose of the information? Is it to inform, teach, sell, entertain or persuade?\n- Do the authors/sponsors make their intentions or purpose clear?\n- Is the information fact, opinion or propaganda?\n- Does the point of view appear objective and impartial?\n- Are there political, ideological, cultural, religious, institutional or personal biases?","lastmodified":"2023-02-01T16:09:41.807673024Z","tags":null},"/notes/Idea-Compass":{"title":"Idea Compass","content":"\nThe Idea Compass is a method of notetaking created by [Fei-Ling Tseng](people/Fei-Ling%20Tseng.md) in her article [The essence of the Zettelkasten method, demystified](https://feeei.blog/essays/the-essence-of-the-zettelkasten-method-demystified/) and explained further in the talk [The Compass of Zettelkasten Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7r9t9T9Aww).\n\nThe core concept is how to expand and explore an idea by having a formalized \"compass\" framework for connecting and linking ideas.\n\nYou start with a particular idea and ask yourself specific questions corresponding to the four cardinal directions.\n\n## North: Upstream\n\n* Where does X come from?\n* What is its origin?\n* What belief does X support?\n* What domain exists an order of magnitude higher?
